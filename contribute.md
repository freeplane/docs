# How to Start Contributing

We're currently looking for contributors for developing the documentation.
If you can write simple step-by-step guides, translate existing text into English, transfer text from our old documentation into the new one, then we could use your help.
You can [start a discussion post (in the docs project)](https://github.com/freeplane/docs/discussions/new) saying you want to contribute to the documentation and the Freeplane team will respond and assist you.

If you have other ways of contributing: developing an addon, sharing your pre-configured mindmap, or suggestions about future development, please feel free to join us in the [Discussions](https://github.com/freeplane/freeplane/discussions)

Every contributor or team member freely decides what task they are going to work on.
However, for making the best decision regarding development, it's advised that we first propose and suggest the idea to the community through a discussion post as to enable early discussion and community feedback.

[Join](Contributing_to_Freeplane's_Development.md) the Freeplane team not only as user but maybe as a

* developer (coder and designer)
* tester (writer of tutorials, screencasts and help texts)
* translator (various languages)
* forum moderator (care for a specific subject)
