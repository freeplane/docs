Freeplane uses a [distributed revision control](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_revision_control) system named *git*. Use this instead of the source packages that are contained in the releases if you plan to take up coding.

This is a guide to Working with freeplane's git repository. The first part
covers the commands you need the most, while the second part ("How to's")
adds some commands for special tasks such as undoing commits or
reverting files (currently there is some redundancy between the two which
we will remove soon).

At least one Freeplane developer learned to use git with the help of an excellent
[German Open Source Press book on git](http://gitbu.ch/).

You can (and probably want to) use eclipse for most operations. We try to
explain this in each section, but it is a good idea to read the
[EGit documentation](http://wiki.eclipse.org/EGit/User_Guide). Some operations,
such as creating remote branches should be applied with the command line only
(e.g. for publishing branches: in order to make sure that tracking branches are setup correctly).

There is a [fun Google Tech Talk](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XpnKHJAok8)
by Linus Torvalds on git and a [excellent introductory Git talk](http://vimeo.com/46010208) by Jessica Kerr.

# Quickstart Guide

This section is meant to be as brief as possible while still explaining the
necessary commands a bit so that you understand what you are doing.

## Installation / Configuration

Install git as [described here](http://git-scm.com/book/en/Getting-Started-Installing-Git).

You probably want to use the latest Eclipse (make sure to get *Eclipse for RCP and RAP Developers*) with the EGit (Eclipse-git) plugin that is part of recent Eclipse builds. Although EGit comes with its own pure java git implementation *JGit*, we rely on a native git for some commands, so please install git as described above, too.

After Git installation, you need to start Git Bash and run the following command line which first set the author details globally (which will be recorded for each changeset):
    $ git config --global user.name "<Firstname> <Lastname>"
    $ git config --global user.email "<email address>"

## Initial checkout ("clone")
### Solution 1: with Git Bash
Create a new directory named 'git' for git repositories:
    $ cd $HOME
    $ mkdir git
    $ cd git

Create a local copy of the (whole!) git repository for Freeplane by *cloning* (git-speak for "checking out"):
    $ git clone https://github.com/freeplane/freeplane.git

This will take 3-20 minutes depending on your network connection. 

Now you can quit Git console:
    $ exit

A local copy of the complete history and all branches has been created. Therefore
it is possible to develop and make commits offline and only connect
for the purpose of getting changes from other devs (*pull*) or sending
your commits to a remote branch (*push*).

Continue with *Post-checkout operations* below!

### Solution 2 : with Eclipse/EGit
you can  clone the repository as follows

* open the Java Perspective
* open the *Git Repositories View* (*Window>Show View->Other...->Git->Git Repositories*)
* select the *Clone a Git repository* option with the URL: https://github.com/freeplane/freeplane.git
* enter credentials, **choose all branches** (!), accept the defaults or choose a different directory location (for the *local* copy of the repo), then check *import all existing projects after clone finishes*, hit *Finish* and be patient (should take <10 minutes)
* **NOTE:**: *import all existing projects after clone finishes* is not needed when using gradle

* **If you already have cloned the repository** just import the projects to eclipse and execute Team->Share project->Git->Use or create repository in parent folder of project
* **Enable following renames in history views.** By default history view does not follow changes resulting from renaming of classes or packages and moving of java classes to other packages. These features should be activated as follows:
    * In Eclipse main menu: Window -> Preferences -> Team -> Git -> History, here you should enable option "Follow Renames" 
    * Using the command line set git option diff.renameLimit to some big number so that commits with big number of changes are properly processed either for the cloned repository or as a global setting:
    $ git config diff.renameLimit 100000
You can change the both settings also from git configuration dialog under eclipse preferences.

**Enable Git keyboard shortcuts.** Funnily enough you have to give Git shortcuts some blessing before they work, see [this Stackoverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/a/12918446/1112408) answer.

## Working with branches

<!--
Freeplane follows the general git convention to have prefixes separated from the name
by a '/', i.e. 'docear/trunk'.
-->

### Overview of structure and commands

Below, you see the a general structure of branches as they are proposed for any Freeplane developer to use. The remote branch *origin/master* is the global master branch for any development aiming a release in an official version. Each developer may fork his own *origin/<devbranch>* (just once) by forking the sources from *origin/master* using the respective Git web site function button. On the local *master*, the developer works out his functions, pushes them up to his *origin/<devbranch>* and updates from *origin/master*. Using the depicted structure, even some GIT commands take an easy form ("$ git push" and "$ git pull" could be executed without further parameters).

![Nnako_UsageOfGit.gif](images/Nnako_UsageOfGit.gif ':size=200')

    LEGEND
    - locations of branches and persons are depicted in BLACK,
    - possible activities are shown in BLUE text.
    - Each activity marked wirh a "star" can be performed by the code developer,
    - the "boxed" activities are performed by the admins.
    - UNDERLINED activities accord to GIT commands,
    - PLAIN activities describe ordinary tasks (e.g. for modification or building of code).

The main branch which was termed *trunk* in BAZAAR, is termed *master* in GIT. It holds all the Freeplane sources. For the Docear main branch, we use *docear/trunk*.  New (feature) branches should always be named <user>/<feature> or (if several devs are
expected to work on a feature) just <feature>. Docear branches should accordingly be prefixed with *docear/*.

### Command sequence and basic steps

Here are the basic commands for working with branches. The diagram is given
just as an overview,
*read the step descriptions in the following sections before trying any git commands*.

![](images/Git-steps.png ':size=200')

1. The remote repository is cloned from origin (sourceforge). You now have a complete local copy of the repository including all branches and the complete history.
2. The user creates (and checks out) a new *local* branch *user/newdev1*.
3. This branch is created on the remote side too (pushed, with *-u* to setup the tracking correctly).
4. After some development on that branch, you want to integrate this with changes in *master*. This is done by pulling from the remote master branch on origin.
5. After having checked the merge (pull = fetch + merge), you push the integrated *user/newdev1* branch to its remote counterpart.
6. You are done with development on *user/newdev1*. In order to merge your changes into *master*, you switch to the master branch (*git checkout master*) and update it (*git pull*).
7. The local *user/newdev* branch is merged into the local *master* branch.
8. After having checked the result of the merge, it is pushed to the *remote* *master* branch.

In the following, development steps which roughly correspond to the commands
above are described.

### Step 1: checkout parent branch

Find and checkout original source branch *'branchname* (the branch you want to base
your work on, **usually master**) to the local work space.

If your parent branch is not the master you should select it first

* Using command line git:
    # fetches the remote (tracking) branch (not necessary if you just cloned the repo)
    $ git pull 
    # switch to ''branchname''
    $ git checkout <branchname>

* Using Eclipse/EGit, 
    * *Team->fetch from upstream* fetches all remote branches (may not be necessary)
    * *Team->Switch To->New branch...*, select *Source ref = refs/remotes/origin/<branchname>*,  *merge* and *checkout new branch*

### Step 2: create your local branch
Create + check out your own *local* branch based on the original branch:
Since branches are really really cheap in git, it makes sense to create a branch
for most development tasks (especially if you want a review before you integrate into master!).
The following command creates a new local branch <devbranch> and switches to it:
    $ git checkout -b <devbranch>

### Step 3: Work locally on your branch
Please read [chapter 2.2 of the official git book](http://git-scm.com/book/en/Git-Basics-Recording-Changes-to-the-Repository)
in order to get started with working with git locally. You should understand how to stage and commit changes.
Here are some basic steps:

* modify/add files...
* add the modifications to the *index*:
    $ git add foo.java # (''Team->Add to index'' in eclipse)

* create a *commit* from the changes in the index:
    $ git commit [-m message] # (''Team->Commit'' in eclipse)
(if you omit -m then you will be prompted for a commit message)

* create more commits, this is all done locally!
* look at the commit graph:
    $ git log # might want to use ''gitk'' as a graphical tool

Eclipse git is also able to do the local commits from the team menu

### Step 4: First push from your new local branch to the repository
Setup git so that only the current "upstream" branch gets pulled/pushed
(instead of pushing *all* branches that have an upstream tracking branch
which can be confusing!):
    $ git config push.default tracking
**Note**: this option is ignored by current EGit. On EGit you get the
same behavior by selecting *Team->Push To Upstream*.

Publish ("push") your branch (including the commits you made) so that
others can see (and review!) it.

**NOTE: Run every push command with --dry-run first!!**

**Currently it's best to do this on the command line, because *push -u* sets up the tracking branch properly.**
*Make sure you use the same name!* *Use --dry-run first*.
    $ <go to the local copy of the repo ("$ cd $HOME/git/freeplane")>
    $ git push -u origin <devbranch> [--dry-run]
You should see a message like:
    Branch user/dev1 set up to track remote branch user/dev1 from origin.

(When pushing from eclipse you ''have to configure the remote tracking
branch'' manually!). In any case (tracking branch configured
automatically or manually), *Team->Push to Upstream* will push the current
branch to its (configured) remote branch on origin.

### Step 5: Development cycles
Follow the cycle:
Switch to the right branch (may not be necessary)
    $ git checkout <devbranch> # ''Team->Switch To->user/dev1'' from EGit 
pull other people's changes on your devbranch (as a beginner you might want to do this on a copy of your repository first, it's all local!)
    $ git pull # ''Team->Pull'' from EGit
(People recommend to use git fetch and git merge instead of git pull)

you might have to resolve conflicts: (might want to use 'git mergetool'
or [Eclipse/EGit](http://wiki.eclipse.org/EGit/User_Guide#Resolving_a_merge_conflict) )
git will place <<<<<<<<<< and >>>>>>>>>> comments to show the locations of the conflict(s)

for each conflict x:

* resolve conflict in *x*, remove markers
* git add x # mark *x* as resolved

to undo the merge you can use
    $ git reset --hard # ''Team->Reset...'' in EGit
**but this will throw away all uncommitted changes(!)**

* commit the conflict resolution(s):
    $ git commit [-m message] # ''Team->Commit'' in EGit

* create local commits (see "Step 3")
* merge changes from master (to integrate the latest code into your feature and to make Step 6 easier)
    $ git pull origin master

* merge changes from master with EGit: 
    * *Team->Fetch from Upstream*
    * *Team->Merge...*, select *origin/master*
* push the result of the merge with master to your remote dev branch (always run git push with --dry-run first!)
    $ git push [--dry-run] # EGit: ''Team->Push to Upstream''
    # (same as ''git push origin <devbranch>'' because tracking is set up)

### Step 6: Merge your development into master
When you are done with your branch, and you have completed a code review of your dev branch, it should be merged into master (!) As a new developer, you **must let a more experienced developer do this**!
    $ git checkout <devbranch> # Switch to <devbranch> in EGit
    $ git pull # ''Team->Pull'' in EGit
    $ git checkout master # Switch to ''master'' in EGit
    $ git pull # ''Team->Pull'' in EGit
    $ git merge <devbranch> # EGit: ''Team->Merge...'', select ''local'' <devbranch>
    $ git push [--dry-run] # EGit: ''Team->Push to Upstream''
    # (same as ''git push origin master'' because tracking is set up)

# How to's
This section contains useful information for working with git, including stuff
like checking that tracking branches are set up correctly, details about working
with branches, undoing commits/reverting files, and a bit more.

## Checkout in more detail
Checking out is termed <tt>cloning</tt> in git speak:

    $ cd ~
    $ mkdir git
    $ cd git
    $ git clone https://github.com/freeplane/freeplane.git freeplane

If you want/have read-only access, use this as the last command:

    $ git clone git://github.com/freeplane/freeplane.git freeplane

However, this will only configure the *master* branch (named *trunk* in
other VCS's such as svn) locally:

    $ git branch -a
    * master
    remotes/origin/HEAD -> origin/master
    remotes/origin/docear/trunk
    remotes/origin/master

In order to check out a branch (which is simply a reference to a commit)
that currently only exists remotely (the remotes/origin/* references are
called *remote tracking branches*), simply switch to that branch:

    $ git checkout docear/trunk

This can be done more easily
[using Eclipse](http://wiki.eclipse.org/EGit/User_Guide#Starting_from_existing_Git_Repositories).
This page also describes how to import a repository into eclipse.

## Using Tags
Show all tags:
    $ git tag

Search for a tag:
    $ git tag -l "release-1.1*"

Show information about a tag:
    $ git show release-1.1.2

Define a tag locally:
    $ git tag -a <tagname>
    # (an editor opens for you to add a description)

Tags are not automatically transferred when doing a <code>git push</code>,
you have to push individually:
    $ git push origin <tagname>
or push *all* tags:
    $ git push --tags origin

You *might* need a
    $ git pull --tags
to get all tags. See git-fetch(1) for situations when you will need this (rarely).

TODO: sign tags?

## Working with branches

Branches are very central to git. Do not hesitate to create feature, team
and (of course) maintenance branches.

You probably want set push.default to *tracking* or *upstream* which
makes sure that *only the current branch* is pushed to its ''upstream
branch'' (and NOT all configured branches):
**Note**: this option is ignored by current EGit. On EGit you get the
same behavior by selecting *Team->Push To Upstream*.

    $ git config push.default tracking

(you can equivalently set this to *upstream* in recent git versions).

### Switch to another branch
    $ git checkout <branchname>

(Team->Switch To->... in Eclipse)

### How to create a new branch

New (feature) branches should be named <code><user>/<feature></code>
or (if several devs work on a feature): <code><feature></code>.

    # commit everything that should go into the new branch
    $ git status
    $ git add <file>
    [...]
    $ git commit -m "my changes"

    # create new branch locally
    $ git checkout -b <newbranch>
 
    # check commit log to see that above commit is in there
    $ git log
 
    # new branch must be visible and selected:
    $ git branch -a  

    # (make sure that the name of the new branch is correct! it is diffcult/impossible
    #  to rename published branches!)
 
    # create branch remotely, use -u to automatically configure upstream location
    $ git push -u origin <newbranch>
    # this should output something like this:
    ''Branch <newbranch> set up to track remote branch <newbranch> from origin.''
    # ('''Note''': -u is important if you want to use git pull/push without
    specifying a remote/refspec)

    # remote branch of <newbranch> must be visible:
    $ git branch -a

So the short story is:
    $ git checkout -b <newbranch>
    $ git push -u origin <newbranch>

### Rename a *local* branch
    $ git branch -m <old-branch-name> <new-branch-name>

TODO: how to rename the remote tracking branch => difficult!!

### How to merge local branches

    $ git checkout <destination_branch>
    $ git merge <source_branch>

If you want to abort a merge (revert the working directory to the state
before the merge command), do this:
 
    $ git reset --hard

(WARNING: this will remove all uncommitted changes!!)

In eclipse, this can be achieved by:

* Team->Switch To and choose <destination_branch>
* Team->Merge... and choose <source_branch>

In Eclipse, you may have to refresh all projects (F5) if a branch
has been added/modified/deleted via the command line.

#### Fast-Forward Merges (merge-nodes)
Often the creation of a merge commit (merge node) is not necessary,
and <code>git merge</code> uses a *fast-forward* merge, omitting
the merge node:

    $ git merge foo
    Updating 9e9a63a..732b657
    Fast-forward
    testfoo.txt |    1 +
    1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)
    create mode 100644 testfoo.txt

results in:

    * 732b657 commit in branch foo
    * [...]

Using the option <code>--no-ff</code> you can force git to create a merge
node even if isn't absolutely necessary (*non-fast-forward* merge):

    $ git merge --no-ff foo2
    Merge made by the 'recursive' strategy.
    testfoo2.txt |    1 +
    1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)
    create mode 100644 testfoo2.txt

which will result in:

    *   3890bc8 (HEAD, master) Merge branch 'foo2'
    |\  
    | * 6bc24c5 (foo2) commit on foo2
    |/  
    * 
    * [...]

This is useful when merging feature branches because it clearly shows
the integration of a new feature. On the other hand, many merge nodes
make the commit graph less readable.

#### Merge master->dev-branch *locally*
    $ git checkout <devbranch>
    $ git merge master

#### Merge dev-branch->master *locally*
    $ git checkout master
    $ git merge <devbranch>

### How to remove a branch

    # remove branch locally
    # (use -D instead if you want to delete a branch that is not fully merged into HEAD!)
    $ git branch -d <branchname>

You can do this with EGit using *Team->Advanced->Delete Branch...*.

If you accidentally deleted a (local) branch, you can recover it by
starting a new branch from the location that <code>git branch -d <branchname></code>
echoed (or by searching for the last commit on that branch in <code>git reflog</code>):

    $ git branch -D foo
    Deleted branch foo (was 732b657).
    $ git branch foo 732b657

(remember that branches are simply pointers to commits)

**Warning**: this only works if the delete was quite recent as orphaned
commits will be deleted after some time!

Delete a remote branch(!):
    $ git push origin --delete <branchname>

Now the local and the remote tracking branch should be gone:
    $ git branch -a
    docear/trunk
    * master
    remotes/origin/docear/trunk
    remotes/origin/master

NOTE: The *stale* branch will still exist in other checkouts, until you
do a:

    $ git remote prune origin

in that other checkout. TODO: but it still exists there as a local branch!

### Check whether your branches are set up correctly
Make sure your branches are set up correctly for push/pull:

    $ git remote show origin
    * remote origin
    Fetch URL: https://github.com/freeplane/freeplane.git
    Push  URL: https://github.com/freeplane/freeplane.git
    HEAD branch: master
    Remote branches:
    docear/trunk tracked
    master       tracked
    Local branches configured for 'git pull':
    docear/trunk merges with remote docear/trunk
    master       merges with remote master
    Local refs configured for 'git push':
    docear/trunk pushes to docear/trunk (up to date)
    master       pushes to master       (up to date)

### Importing a remote branch
Using command line git:
    $ git pull # fetches the remote (tracking) branch
    $ git checkout <branchname>

Using Eclipse/EGit:

* *Team->Pull* fetches the remote (tracking) branch
* *Team->Switch To->New branch...*, select *Source ref = refs/remotes/origin/<name>*

## General workflow

Create a dev branch (see section on creating branches above).

### Work on your feature branch
    # switch to feature branch
    $ git checkout <feature>

    # fetch and merge changes (in case another dev works on this)
    $ git pull

    # you might have to resolve conflicts: (might want to use 'git mergetool'
    # or [http://wiki.eclipse.org/EGit/User_Guide#Resolving_a_merge_conflict Eclipse/EGit])
    for each conflict x:
    1. resolve conflict in x, remove markers
    2. git add x # mark as resolved
    # commit the conflict resolution(s)
    $ git commit

    $ git add ...
    $ git commit
    [...]

    # This will push commits to the remote branch that is tracked
    # make sure that push.default=tracking|upstream (see above),
    # otherwise other branches will be pushed as well!
    $ git push [--dry-run]

### Merging
Merge master -> <devbranch> (see section on merging above) every
once-in-a-while.

After a final code review (on your dev branch), merge <devbranch> ->
master (see section on merging above).

## Miscellaneous

### Revert (reset) files
    git checkout <filename>

In EGit do this: Right-click on file -> Replace With -> HEAD Revision

Revert all files in working copy (!):
    git reset --hard

### Undoing/editing commits
TODO: how to remove/edit a commit locally using rebase.

### Undoing a commit that is already pushed
Use <code>git revert <commit-hash></code>, like this:
    $ git revert b1e9b4c9755b091f95aaa3035aca04dcb02ec1fd

This will generate an inverse commit, it will *not* remove the original commit:
    * 171881e (HEAD, master) Revert "a simple commit"
    * b1e9b4c a simple commit

### Avoid entering passwords on each commit
At least if you use the command line git interface you should consider to deposit your public ssh key at github. See the [section about ssh configuration](https://help.github.com/categories/56/articles) on github.
