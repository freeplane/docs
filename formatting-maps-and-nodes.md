# Formatting maps and nodes

## Map background
There are several options to change the map background: `Format->Map background`

* Background color
* Background image (with the option "fit to window")

## Formatting nodes

The most straightforward way to format a node is to use the formatting toolbar or hot keys, like `Ctrl+B` for bold.

There's also `Tool panel` (right-hand-side panel), which lists all formatting properties that can be set on a node.
It can be opened by right-clicking on the mind map background and selecting `Tool panel`.

In addition to formatting an entire node, it is possible to format each character/word in the node.
It can be done by using the dialog editor `Edit->Node code->Edit node core in dialog (Alt+Enter)`.

?> Note: It's also possible to use the hot keys (e.g. `Ctrl+L` for blue) in the in-line editor.

### Using Format

Formats allows to apply a special data format, e.g. a special or number date format.
If for instance a date has the standard format 28/12/2012 it can be reformatted as 12/28/2012 by applying the format mm/dd/yyyy to the node.
See [Data recognition and data formats](Data_recognition_and_data_formats.md) for details.

Another application of the format is to define text templates, such as a prefix like "Beware: ". In text templates "%s" represent the original node text like in "Beware: %s".

By setting format to "Text" you switch all formatting off.

## Styles

Finally, a node can be formatted by applying a style to the node â†’ [styles](styles.md)
