## How to get help

Freeplane is a non-commercial project.
It lives by our active and vibrant [community](contribute/Contributing_to_Freeplane's_Development.md), where we try to support each other in order to develop and provide an outstanding knowledge management application.
Please, feel free to discuss Freeplane and its features with other interested Freeplane users. For this purpose, we provided two forums (see structure picture on the right):

We invite you to do the following things:

in our **[DISCUSSIONS FORUM](https://github.com/freeplane/freeplane/discussions)**

* discuss the usage of existing features
* discuss the suitability of new features
* discuss the development of [existing scripts](scripting/Scripts_collection.md) and new ones

New bug reports go into the [bug reports](https://github.com/freeplane/freeplane/issues/new?template=bug_report.md)

New feature requests go into the [feature requests](https://github.com/freeplane/freeplane/issues/new?template=feature_request.md)

Freeplane's old user forums are archived [here](https://sourceforge.net/p/freeplane/discussion/758437) and [here](https://www.freeplane.org/forum2012/viewforum.php?f=1).
