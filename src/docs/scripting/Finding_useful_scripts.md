There are many scripts and Add-ons spread over the internet. Here are some suggestions of how to search for those scripts:

Inside this documentation:
- [The Add-ons page](Add-ons_(install).md)
- [The scripts collection](Scripts_collection.md)
- [Scripts for text editing](Scripting_text_editing.md)
- [Script incubator](Script_incubator.md)
- [Scripts using external libraries](Example_scripts_using_external_libraries.md)
- The [API reference](Reference.md) gives very simple example of most of the methods in the API
- The [scripting examples section](examples/scripting_examples) has a couple of scripts. But, this section is still in initial stages
