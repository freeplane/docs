In the [Scripting API](Scripting_API.md) you will find all public methods that can be used in scripts.

If you are not sure about how a method needs to be written, you can see examples of each method at this [reference page](Reference.md).

For a quick reference, use the [Cheatsheet](Scripting_Cheatsheet.md).
