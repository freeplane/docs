Scripts are a set of instructions that tell a computer program how to perform specific tasks. Think of a script like a recipe for a computer. Just as a recipe guides you through the steps to make a dish, a script guides the computer through the steps to complete an action.

When you're using a software program like Freeplane, which helps you organize information visually, you might find that there are certain tasks you do repeatedly. Maybe you always format text the same way, or you combine pieces of information in a specific pattern. Doing this manually each time can be tedious and time-consuming. That’s where scripts come in handy.

Scripts automate these repetitive tasks. Someone who knows how to write scripts can set up a sequence of actions, like changing text color or moving information from one place to another. Once the script is written, you can run it with a simple command, and the script will do all the steps for you quickly and accurately.

More advanced scripts allow the user to customize the Interface and behavior of Freeplane, in order to make it fit exactly to the user needs. Advanced scripts are usually transformed in Add-ons, but they are essentially the same thing.

As an example of what an advanced script can do, you can watch [this detailed video presentation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSyhkcsB2-M) of MapInsight, which expands the Freeplane capabilities in order to fulfill very specific needs from the user.

The beauty of scripts is that they can be shared. If someone creates a useful script, they can give it to other Freeplane users, who can then use it without having to know anything about programming. It’s a way to customize and enhance the functionality of the program to better suit your individual needs or the needs of a group.
