* By default an English dictionary for the spell checker is installed. For other languages see below. 
* The menu structure is available in an increasingly number of [languages](https://www.freeplane.org/cgi-bin/translist.cgi). In the program, in menu *Tools > Preferences*, the language for the menu's can be changed. * For more information, see mind map *Index wiki* (upper right corner), branch Intall.

# Installation (development version)
Freeplane is being developed fast. If you want to use the newest functionality consider using a beta version. Besides you are invited to take part in testing the preview versions.

## Install beta version
A beta version is a complete version of Freeplane with all new functionality of the coming new stable version and which is being installed in the same way as the stable version, with a set-up file which will automatically install Java too. Go to [beta version](http://sourceforge.net/projects/freeplane/files/freeplane%20beta/), download the Freeplane-SetupXXX.exe and execute this file. For non-windows operating systems, see [Category:System](Category:System.md). Read [here](Category:Change_log.md) about changes between program versions.

## Install last preview version
A preview version contains new functionality the programmers are still working on. Installing a preview version  supposes that you have Java installed on your computer. 

Go to [preview](http://sourceforge.net/projects/freeplane/files/freeplane%20preview/) and download Freeplane_bin-XXXX.zip, in which XXXX is a shown version number. Unpack the zip file, at any place you want. If your intention is to only test the new version: In Windows click freeplane.exe; you could also connect freeplane.exe to the task bar. If you want the new version to automatically start if you click on any mind map, just overwrite the directories of the older version with those of the newer version. For other operating systems, see [Category:System](Category:System.md). Read [here](Category:Change_log.md) about changes between program versions.

# Publishing maps on line
Freeplane lets you export a map for publishing it on Internet or Intranet. If you have multiple maps to publish and maintain, it is more economic to use the procedure described [***here***](Publishing_maps_on_line.md). The maps in [Freeplane Tutorial Extensions](Freeplane_Tutorial_Extensions.md) are published in this way.

# Making a Freeplane animation or video
Freeplane maps can be used as a basis for creating an animation or video. There is a [How to guide](Videos_and_animations_How-to.md) with guidelines to create a high quality, low storage Freeplane animation or video.
