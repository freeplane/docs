# Spell checker how-to

To enable spell checking, select one of the supported languages using pop-up menu→languages→`[your language]`. from any editor.

Some spell checker options can be configured from Preferences-&gt;Behavior-&gt;Spell checker options.

User can add his personal words for a particular language from the context menu on word selection. The first time user adds a custom word, a user dictionary file is automatically generated in <freeplane-install>UserDictionary_XX.txt (where XX is the language code, for instance UserDictionary_en.txt stores english custom words). This text file can be created or edited with any text editor for instance to add new words in a bulk way or to remove a custom word added by error.

You can install another dictionaries copying them into &lt;freeplane-install&gt;/resources/ortho. The dictionary files dictionary_XX.ortho converted from [aspell](http://aspell.net/) are available on http://sourceforge.net/projects/freeplane/files/spell_check_dictionaries/ .
